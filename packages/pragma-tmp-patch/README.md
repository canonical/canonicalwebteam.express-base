## Temporary module

This module is just here as a temporary fix for some issues found in pragma/react/ssr library.
The same changes here are in a PR open upstream.

It is to be removed once the changes are merged and released upstream.
And the code in the `example` website can then pass to depend on upstream seamlessly.
